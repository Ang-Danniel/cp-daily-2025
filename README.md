# üß† CP Daily 2025 ‚Äì Competitive Programming Practice

This repository is a collection of my daily Competitive Programming solutions and learning. It includes problems from contests, topic-based practice, and curated problem sets.

---

## üìÅ Folder Structure & Naming Convention

### `contest/<platform>-<event>-<round>`
Problems from specific contests.
- Example: `contest/cf-edu-180-div2`
- File format: `A_problem-name.ext`, `B_another-problem.cpp`

### `topic/<primary-topic>[__subtopics]/`
For topic-based learning.
- Example: `topic/dp/`, `topic/graph__union-find/`
- Use double underscores for combined topics.
- File names are flexible but should be readable.

### `mixed/<set-name>/`
For curated lists (from books, blogs, sheets).
- Example: `mixed/my-top-50/`

---

## üí° Conventions

- Use **snake_case** for problem file names.
- Include the **problem link** in a comment at the top of each file.
- Use platform-specific code styles (e.g., `cin/cout` for Codeforces).
- Try to add brief notes or explanations below your code when possible.

---

## ‚úÖ Goals

- Practice daily to improve consistency and thinking speed.
- Build a searchable archive of problems I've solved.
- Reflect on each solution to deepen understanding.

---

## üß© Commit Message Formatting

We follow a **template-driven** and **conventional** style:

```text
$type($scope)? : short summary (imperative, ‚â§‚ÄØ50 chars)

(optional body: wrap ~72 chars; explain what and why)
```

List of type allowed: 
- ac, tle, wa, mle, ce (if it get submitted but no change)
- prog (if it didn't finished and didn't get submitted yet)
- fix (fixing certain code in solution)
- note (adding readme for more context)
- refactor (code improvement)
- etc (TBA)
